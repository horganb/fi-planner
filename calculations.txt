total at retirement age = currentTotal * 1.1^(retirement age - age)
spendingAmount * 1.03^(retirement age - age) / (1 - withdrawalTax) = total at retirement age * safeWithdrawalRate
spendingAmount * 1.03^(retirement age - age) = currentTotal * 1.1^(retirement age - age) * safeWithdrawalRate
1.1^(retirement age - age) / 1.03^(retirement age - age) = spendingAmount / (safeWithdrawalRate * currentTotal)
(1.1/1.03)^(retirement age - age) = spendingAmount / (safeWithdrawalRate * currentTotal)

total A at retirement age = currentTotalA * 1.1^(retirement age - age)
total B at retirement age = currentTotalB * 1.1^(retirement age - age)
spendingAmount * 1.03^(retirement age - age) / (1 - withdrawalTaxA) = total A at retirement age * safeWithdrawalRate
spendingAmount * 1.03^(retirement age - age) / (1 - withdrawalTaxB) = total B at retirement age * safeWithdrawalRate
totalSpendingAmount = [total A at retirement age * (1 - withdrawalTaxA) + total B at retirement age * (1 - withdrawalTaxB)] * safeWithdrawalRate / 1.03^(retirement age - age)
totalSpendingAmount = [currentTotalA * (1 - withdrawalTaxA) + currentTotalB * (1 - withdrawalTaxB)] * 1.1^(retirement age - age) * safeWithdrawalRate / 1.03^(retirement age - age)

total A at retirement age = currentTotalA * 1.1^(retirement age - age)
// get contributionsA every two weeks
+ contributionsA * 1.1^(retirement age - age) + contributionsA * 1.1^(retirement age - age - 1/26) + contributionsA * 1.1^(retirement age - age - 2/26) + ...
SUM[years invested, starts at retirement age - age, ends at 0, increases by 1/26] contributionsA * 1.1^years invested
